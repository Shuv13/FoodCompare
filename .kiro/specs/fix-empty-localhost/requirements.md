# Requirements Document - Fix Empty Localhost Issue

## Introduction

The FoodCompare application server is running successfully on localhost:3000, but the browser shows an empty page instead of the expected landing page. This spec outlines the requirements to diagnose and resolve this issue to ensure the application renders properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Application Loading Diagnosis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify why the localhost page is empty, so that I can understand what's preventing the application from rendering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is running on localhost:3000 THEN the browser console SHALL show any JavaScript errors or warnings
2. WHEN accessing localhost:3000 THEN the network tab SHALL show successful loading of all required assets (CSS, JS, fonts)
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the React DevTools SHALL show the component tree is mounting correctly
4. IF there are compilation errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages in the browser
5. WHEN checking the server logs THEN any server-side rendering errors SHALL be visible

### Requirement 2: Core Application Functionality Verification

**User Story:** As a user, I want the FoodCompare homepage to load properly, so that I can access the food comparison features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting localhost:3000 THEN the page SHALL display the FoodCompare landing page with hero section
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the navigation bar SHALL be visible and functional
3. WHEN the page renders THEN all UI components (buttons, inputs, cards) SHALL display correctly
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the search functionality SHALL be accessible
5. WHEN navigating to different routes (/compare, /search, etc.) THEN each page SHALL render without errors

### Requirement 3: Build and Development Environment Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the build process and development environment are configured correctly, so that the application can run without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm run build THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully without errors
2. WHEN starting the development server THEN all dependencies SHALL be properly resolved
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the TypeScript compilation SHALL complete without errors
4. WHEN accessing the application THEN all CSS styles SHALL load and apply correctly
5. WHEN the server starts THEN the Socket.IO integration SHALL not interfere with page rendering
6. WHEN using Docker THEN the containerized environment SHALL provide consistent runtime behavior
7. WHEN running in Docker THEN all environment variables and dependencies SHALL be properly configured

### Requirement 4: Routing and Page Navigation Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application routes to work correctly, so that I can navigate between different sections of the FoodCompare app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting the root route (/) THEN the home page SHALL render the complete landing page
2. WHEN navigating to /compare THEN the price comparison page SHALL load with proper Suspense handling
3. WHEN accessing /search THEN the search page SHALL display correctly
4. WHEN visiting /dining THEN the dining reservations page SHALL render properly
5. WHEN accessing /quick-delivery THEN the quick delivery page SHALL show the coming soon message
6. WHEN navigating between routes THEN the page transitions SHALL work smoothly without blank screens

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging information, so that I can quickly identify and resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are runtime errors THEN the application SHALL display helpful error boundaries
2. WHEN components fail to render THEN the system SHALL provide fallback UI
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be shown to users
4. WHEN development mode is active THEN detailed error information SHALL be available in console
5. WHEN the application encounters issues THEN the error messages SHALL include actionable debugging information
